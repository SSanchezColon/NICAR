## Why R + Markdown?

### Markdown

Super simple way to add formating to plain text

- headers
- bold
- bullet lists
- links

Created by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) as a simple way for non-programming types to write in an easy-to-read format that could be converted directly into HTML.

### R code

```
boston_payroll %>%
  group_by(TITLE) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(mean), REGULAR, OVERTIME)
```

### .Rmd files

<div style="float:left; padding-right:20px"><img src="images/rmdfiles.png"></div>
An R Markdown (.Rmd) file is a record of your analysis process. 

It contains the code that a scientist needs to reproduce your work along with the narration that a reader needs to understand your work.

**Literate programming**

### Show your work

**Everyone's doing it!**

### Reproducible research

The idea that data analyses, and more generally, stories, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.

* Look for insight deeper than the summary report
* Verify details yourself
* Learn new techniques from looking at other processes
* Figure out ways to apply the analysis to your own needs
* Your future self will thank you for documenting your process now

At the click of a button, or the type of a command, you can rerun the code in an R Markdown file to reproduce your work and export the results as a finished report.

R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including

- HTML
- PDF
- MS Word
- Beamer
- HTML5 slides
- Tufte-style handouts
- books
- dashboards
- scientific articles (white pages)
- websites

### Produce slick-looking PDFs

Be sure to get [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed first.

### IPython Notebooks

### How .rmd files render in Github

<img src="images/markdownoutput.png" height="300">

Not well.

**That's fine, I'm not mad**

```{r datatable, warning=F, message=F}
library(DT)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
payroll <- read_csv("../data/bostonpayroll2013.csv") %>% 
  select(NAME, TITLE, DEPARTMENT, REGULAR, OVERTIME) %>% 
  filter(row_number()<100)
datatable(payroll, extensions = 'Buttons', options = list(
    dom = 'Bfrtip',
    buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
  )
)
```

### Output .Rmd files to HTML

#### Links not attachments!

<img src="images/link.gif">

Reporters sometimes aren't very organized. Send them links instead!

####Host the files on an internal server
<img src="images/S3.png">

I have the code above aliased so I can type in a keyword and it will move all html files in a certain directory to an S3 server while preserving the structure of the subdirectories.

### Host the HTML of your analysis

- Internally or
- On Github pages
- Share with reporters and editors, let them explore your analysis further
- Let them download customized spreadsheets with buttons in the `DT` [(datatable) package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/extensions.html)
- If your analysis gets updated, keep the file name then they only have to refresh their link
- Then get into Shiny!



## Coding in RMarkdown

### 1. Open a new .Rmd file

at **File > New File > R Markdown**. 

<div style="max-width:500px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/menu.png"></div>

Title the R Markdown file and select **HTML** as the output for now.

<div style="max-width:400px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/html.png"></div>

### .Rmd structure

<div style="width:50%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/layout2.png"></div>

**YAML HEADER**

Optional section of render options written as **key:value** pairs.

- At start of file
- Between lines of **---** (3 dashes)

**CODE CHUNKS**

Chunks of embedded R code. Each chunk:

- begins with **```{r}** (the key to the left of 1)
- ends with **```**

**TEXT**

Narration formatted with markdown mixed with code chunks.


### 2. Write document

Edit the default template by putting in your own code and text.

Intersperse the text with your code to tell a story.

### 2b. Label your chunks of code

You'll see why in a moment.

<img src="images/labels.png">

### 2c. Notebooks style

You can run individual chunks of code before generating the full report to see how it looks.

Click the green arrow next to each chunk.

<img src="images/chunky.png">


### 3. Knit document to create report

Use knit button or type **render()** to knit

<div style="width:60%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/knit_button.png"></div>

### 3b. Check out the build log

Down in the console. Warnings and errors will appear.

Also measures progress by chunks, which is why it's important to label them.

<img src="images/console.png">

### 4. Preview output in IDE window

<img src="images/preview.png">

### 5. Output file

You have a .Rmd file and clicking knit HTML also generated a .html file

<div style="width:50%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/testpage.png"></div>

### Datatables

You need to load libraries just like you would a normal script.

Let's look at the data in R Markdown with a new package called [`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) that uses the Datatables [jquery library](https://datatables.net/).

Example from **Part 1** in the `chunks.MD` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbtran/NICAR/master/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/chunks.MD).

Open and knit `chunks/01-chunk.Rmd`


## Specific features

### Hide warnings, messages

Adding `warning=F` and `message=F` hid the little messages.

Example from **Part 2** in the `chunks.MD` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbtran/NICAR/master/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/chunks.MD).

Open and knit `chunks/02-chunk.Rmd`

### Hide code

If the person you're sharing this with has no interest in the code and only the quick results, use `echo=F` to hide the chunk of code and just display the output.

Example from **Part 3** in the `chunks.MD` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbtran/NICAR/master/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/chunks.MD).

Open and knit `chunks/03-chunk.Rmd`

### Inline R code

Embed lines of R code within the narrative with

<div style="width:50%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/inline.png"></div>

Example from **Part 4** in the `chunks.MD` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbtran/NICAR/master/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/chunks.MD).

Open and knit `chunks/04-chunk.Rmd`


### Pretty tables

Make pretty tables with the `knitr` package and the `kable` function.

Example from **Part 5** in the `chunks.MD` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbtran/NICAR/master/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/chunks.MD).

Open and knit `chunks/05-chunk.Rmd`

### Change theme and style

Change the appearance and style of the HTML document by changing the theme up top.

Options from the [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme library includes:

- `default`
- `cerulean`
- `journal`
- `cosmo`

highlights 

- `tango`
- `pygments`
- `kate`

Example from **Part 6** in the `chunks.MD` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbtran/NICAR/master/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/chunks.MD).

Open and knit `chunks/06-chunk.Rmd`


### Table of contents

Add a floating table of contents by changing `html_document` to `toc: true` and `toc_float: true`.

Example from **Part 7** in the `chunks.MD` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbtran/NICAR/master/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/chunks.MD).

Open and knit `chunks/07-chunk.Rmd`


### Next steps?

Exporting as a PDF will require LaTex installed first
  * Get it from [latex-project.org](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) or [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
