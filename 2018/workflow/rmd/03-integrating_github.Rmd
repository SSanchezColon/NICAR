Version control system (vcs)

Git has been "repurposed" beyond software development

Journalists use it for methodology, but also to share raw and summarized data.

# For teams to collaborate

**It's kinda complicated**

So why?

Tough to justify for someone solo.

But it's worth learning because of the capabilities for communicating your analysis and for future collaboration.

# Setting up Github

A walkthrough explaining how to get connected later:

## [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/)

**Options**

- [Github](http://www.github.com)
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

Show off! Collaborate!

- The R Community is active on Github
- The more often you use it, the more often you can use others' code and data
- Easily import from Github repos into your workflow
- Simple to run [Shiny Apps locally](https://github.com/yonicd/gunflow) with `runGithub` function

# Markdown and Rmarkdown

Github loves Markdown. Even Rmarkdown.

Renders it as HTML.

# Hosting with Github Pages

**Turn [http://github.com/username/reponame/index.html](http://github.com/username/reponame/index.html)**

**Into [http://username.github.io/reponame/index.html](http://username.github.io/reponame/index.html)**

# Setting up GH Pages

After uploading your repo, click on **Settings**

Change the *Source* from `None` to `master branch` or `master branch\docs` (depending on where you want your root to be)

# .gitignore large files

- Don't include files larger than 100 mb
- Don't include your keys or passwords
- Try to exclude any extraneous files like r history

You can borrow [this one](https://github.com/wpinvestigative/kushner_eb5_census/blob/master/.gitignore)

# Include readmes and data dictionaries

- [Buzzfeed](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/everything) is a good model for how they index their story links and repos as a table

# Please don't create monster data repos
