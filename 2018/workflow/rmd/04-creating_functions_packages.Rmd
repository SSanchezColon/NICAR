## Creating functions and packages

### Sisyphus

Find yourself repeating the same tasks over and over again?

**Example:**

- Analyzing data that's published regularly
- Always replacing that one county name so it matches a lookup file
- Adjusting summary state data for population.

### Reproducibility

Save your most common tasks as a function

<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/6917/products/sisyphus-shirt.gif?v=1414446009" width="100%">

# Introducing the example 

Open `rmd/04-function_example.Rmd` and run the chunks when spotted

Data with counts by state

```{r }
sb <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gH6eUQVQsEmFagy0qzQDEuwb3cutMWaddCLc7ESbzjc/pub?gid=294374511&single=true&output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

# sb <- read.csv("sb.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
```
<img src="images/sbcount.png">

What would be a problem with this data set if we tried to map it?

That's right, it's raw data that hasn't be adjusted for population yet.

This is a problem that we have to deal with all the time.

Let's make it easier on ourselves in the future by dealing with it now.

1. Start with a look up file

(You can bring in a Google Sheet if you publish as a CSV and copy the link over)

<img src="images/lookup.png">

```{r }
pop <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16oW_uvRJCNoOnCeAkJH4fDouFokjaGUdGFUCaFdKd6I/pub?output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

# pop <- read.csv("pop.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
```

2. Figure out the columns to join by

Which ones match? 

<img src="images/columns.png">

This is what it looks like when joined.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
sb_adjusted <- left_join(sb, pop, by=c("State_Abbreviation"="Abbrev"))

library(knitr)
kable(head(sb_adjusted, 3))
```

And how it looks after some math.

```{r }
sb_adjusted$per_capita <- sb_adjusted$Starbucks/sb_adjusted$Population*100000
kable(head(sb_adjusted, 3))
```

# Turn your code into a function

### Adjust the code for general data sets

**First, establish some rules**

All data sets you want to join with the population data set:

1. First column will contain either the full state name or the state abbreviation
2. Second column will have values you want to adjust for population

Now, rewrite the code so it's more generalized. As in, it can deal with any data set you give it.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Save the dataframe as a consistent name
any_df <- sb

# Rename the first column to "Abbrev"
colnames(any_df)[1] <- "Abbrev"

# Join by the similar name
df_adjusted <- left_join(any_df, pop, by="Abbrev")

# Do the calculations based on the values in the second column
df_adjusted$per_capita <- df_adjusted[,2] / df_adjusted$Population * 100000

kable(head(df_adjusted, 3))
```

### Function and variables
Turn your lines of code into a function by wrapping it with 

`function(arg1, arg2, ... ){` and `}`

Remember how there were two types of State ID data? 

Full name and abbreviations. 

We can write the function so you can tell it to join based on what type it should join by.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
pc_adjust <- function(any_df, state_type){
  pop <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16oW_uvRJCNoOnCeAkJH4fDouFokjaGUdGFUCaFdKd6I/pub?output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
  # pop <- read.csv("pop.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
  # State type options are either "Abbrev" or "State"
colnames(any_df)[1] <- state_type
df_adjusted <- left_join(any_df, pop, by=state_type)
df_adjusted$per_capita <- df_adjusted[,2] / df_adjusted$Population * 1000000
return(df_adjusted)
}
```

---

***Test it out***

Start out with `sb` dataframe.

```{r }
kable(head(sb, 3))
```

Apply the function `pc_adjust` to `sb` with the variable `Abbrev`.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
test <- pc_adjust(sb, "Abbrev")
kable(head(test, 3))
```

Success!

### Test it on another data set

Alright, we've got it working with Starbucks data.

Let's try it with Dunkin' Donuts data.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
dd <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TWuWZpfDUMWmMpc7aPqUQ-g1a1J0rUO8_cle_zcPyI8/pub?gid=1983903926&single=true&output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

# dd <- read.csv("dd.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

kable(head(dd))
```

The state identification is spelled out this time and not abbreviated.

Fortunately, we accounted for that when making the formula.

Run this code.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
dd_adjusted <- pc_adjust(dd, "State")

kable(head(dd_adjusted))
```

**Yay, we did it!**

```
pc_adjust() is your tiny perfect function
```

**Keep going!**

# Turn your function into a package

For everyone to use.

Select **File > New Project > New Directory > R Package**

<div style="max-width:500px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/pckg1.png"></div>

### Name the package

One word. Some [tips](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html) on figuring out the best name.

<div style="max-width:500px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/pckg2.png"></div>

---

**Three components**

* An `R/` folder where you save your function code - [more details](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#r)
* A basic `DESCRIPTION` file for package metadata - [more details](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html#description)
* A basic `NAMESPACE` file, which is only necessary if you're submitting to CRAN - [more details](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html#namespace)

<div style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/pckg4.png" ></div>


***Welcome script***

<img src="images/pckg3.png" width="100%">


### Edit the DESCRIPTION file

<div style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><img src="images/desc.png"></div>


Questions about which License to use? Check out [the options](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html#license).


<img src="images/details.png" width="100%">

Also, notice that I added `Imports: dplyr` because this function won't work without the `left_join` function from **dplyr**.

### Create a new script

Copy and paste the `pc_adjust` function you made into a new script file.

```
pc_adjust <- function(any_df, state_type){
  pop <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16oW_uvRJCNoOnCeAkJH4fDouFokjaGUdGFUCaFdKd6I/pub?output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
  # pop <- read.csv("pop.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
  # State type options are either "Abbrev" or "State"
colnames(any_df)[1] <- state_type
df_adjusted <- left_join(any_df, pop, by=state_type)
df_adjusted$per_capita <- df_adjusted[,2] / df_adjusted$Population * 1000000
return(df_adjusted)
}
```

### Save as new script in the R folder

Name the file after the function, `pc_adjust` and save it into the `R/` folder

<img src="images/new_script.png" width="100%">


### Add documentation 

**To your script**

Go back to your `pc_adjust.R` script and add these lines above the code.

```
#' Population adjuster
#'
#' This function appends state population data
#' @param any_df The name of the dataframe you want to append to
#' @param state_type if state identification is abbreviations, use "Abbrev" if full state name, use "State"
#' @keywords per capita
#' @import dplyr
#' @export
#' @examples
#' pc_adjust(dataframe, "Abbrev")

```

What is all that gibberish?

<img src="images/popup.png">

These special comments above the function will be compiled into the correct format.

Watch.

Run these lines in console.

```
install.packages("roxygen2")
library(roxygen2)
roxygenise()
```

It wrote to the `NAMESPACE` file and created a `pc_adjust.Rd` file based on the special comments.

<img src="images/roxy.png" width="100%">

Find and open pc_adjust.Rd in the man folder.

<img src="images/roxygenise.png" width="100%">

This would've been tough to put together by hand.

### Build your package

Press `Cmd + Shift + B` to build the package.

**Now, you have your package forever and ever.**

Just run

```
install.packages("whateveryoucalledyourpackage")
```

and you can run `pc_adjust` whenever you want.

## Your help file

Type
```
?pc_adjust
```
<img src="images/helpfile.png" width="100%">

This is what your special comments above your R function helped generate.

Hold up.

### Upload package folder to Github

<img src="images/github.png" width="100%">

Let others download and use your R package.

Here's how the [easy way](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) and here's the [official way](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

This means you have to add some clean documentation, such as a `readme.MD` file.

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("andrewbtran/abtnicarr")
library(abtnicarr)
```

### Next steps

Keep adding functions to your package.

Perhaps, create a [Shiny version](http://shiny.trendct.org/ctnamecleaner/) of it for those who don't use R.

Over time you'll build up a bunch that you'll rely on over and over again.

If it's awesome, submit it to CRAN.

This was an extremely simple version of making a package.
